- [0x00. Pascal's Triangle] (./0x00-pascal_triangle)

Create a function that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle.

- [0x01. Lockboxes](./0x01-lockboxes)

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

- [0x02. Minimum Operations](./0x02-minimum_operations)

In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

- [0x03. Log Parsing](./0x03-log_parsing)

Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics

- [0x04. UTF-8 Validation](./0x04-utf8_validation)

Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

- [0x05. N Queens](./0x05-nqueens)

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

- [0x06. Star Wars API](./0x06-starwars_api)

Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie

- [0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix](./0x07-rotate_2d_matrix)

Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

- [0x08. Making Change](./0x08-making_change)

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount 'total'.

- [0x09. Island Perimeter](./0x09-island_perimeter)

Create a function def island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid

- [0x0A. Prime Game](./0x0A-primegame)

Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.
